# Snake, Water and Gun Game using Python
So this repository consists of an intriguing game which is called Snake, water and gun similar to rock-paper-scissors. 
In this code, I have used 'random', to get random inputs by computer, so its basically playing with the computer itself.
There are 2 python files- One consists of a straight-forward, easy to understand and quite lengthy code and the other is based on advnaced logic by observation which makes the code shorter.
Either way the code runs the same and its fun to play. 
Also uses the basic if-else statements, input by user and dictionaries.
(Beginner Friendly)
